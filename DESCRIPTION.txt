Description of the tasks completed.
Have completed the tasks WEB-103, WEB-120, WEB-203 and WEB-301 as mentioned in the mail by Patrick.

Here are some details that may be helpful:
1) Have included git commit messages after completing each tasks so the same can be checked by going to a particular commit in git log.
2) As for WEB-120, have used sessionStorage.
3) For WEB-203, have used redux.
4) For WEB-301, decided to go with incremental-dom and implemented the same.

Some more changes can make the code better :)
Cheers,
Sid
